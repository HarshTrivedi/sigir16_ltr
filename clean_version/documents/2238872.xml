  <title>PhylomeDB: a database for genome-wide collections of gene phylogenies
</title>
  <abstract>
 The complete collection of evolutionary histories of all genes in a genome, also known as phylome, constitutes a valuable source of information. The reconstruction of phylomes has been previously prevented by large demands of time and computer power, but is now feasible thanks to recent developments in computers and algorithms. To provide a publicly available repository of complete phylomes that allows researchers to access and store large-scale phylogenomic analyses, we have developed PhylomeDB. PhylomeDB is a database of complete phylomes derived for different genomes within a specific taxonomic range. All phylomes in the database are built using a high-quality phylogenetic pipeline that includes evolutionary model testing and alignment trimming phases. For each genome, PhylomeDB provides the alignments, phylogentic trees and tree-based orthology predictions for every single encoded protein. The current version of PhylomeDB includes the phylomes of Human, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bacterium Escherichia coli, comprising a total of 32 289 seed sequences with their corresponding alignments and 172 324 phylogenetic trees. PhylomeDB can be publicly accessed at http://phylomedb.bioinfo.cipf.es

  <content>
 A phylome is defined as the complete collection of phylogenies reconstructed for every single gene encoded in a genome (1). Although the term was coined several years ago, the development of high-quality, genome-wide collections of phylogenetic trees has been previously prevented due to large demands of time and computer power. Only recently, and thanks to new and faster algorithms and computers, the application of phylogenetics to whole genomes has become feasible. Large-scale phylogenetic studies provide very valuable information on the evolutionary relationships between genes of different species (2). Among other applications, the availability of complete phylomes can be exploited to map duplication and speciation events and thus infer orthology relationships (3), to determine the evolutionary relationships among taxa (4) and even to reconstruct ancestral metabolisms (5). Although some databases provide automatically derived and curated phylogenies (6&#x2013;9), these follow a family-based approach, since they first group the genes into families and subsequently build a single phylogeny for each family. Moreover, the selection of species included is determined by the specific scopes of these databases. PhylomeDB provides phylomes reconstructed following a gene-based approach (3), in which the same high-quality phylogenetic pipeline is applied to each single gene encoded in a given genome. The resulting trees, alignments and tree-based orthology predictions can be easily accessed, queried and downloaded through a user-friendly web interface. In this article, the data content and web features of the first release of PhylomeDB are described. Screenshot of a PhylomeDB entry page. The entry page of an individual seed protein (Hsa0017176) of the human phylome (Hsapiens001), includes information on the sequence and links to (i) the feature page containing all necessary information of the phylogenetic pipeline used; (ii) all the phylogenetic trees derived by the different programs and models used in the pipeline, in this case a NJ tree, ML trees derived from JTT, WAG, RtREV and BLOSUM62 models, and the consensus tree derived from the Bayesian analyses; (iii) the raw and trimmed (clean) alignments and (iv) the list of tree-based orthology predictions for the species included in the tree.

Current content in phylomeDB For each phylome included in the current release of PhylomeDB, the PhylomeDB internal code, the number of seed proteins, the number of species included, the total number of phylogenetic trees, the phylogenetic reconstruction methods and a brief description is provided. Phylogenetic methods are indicated as follows: Neighbor Joining (NJ), Bayesian analysis (Bayesian) and Maximum Likelihood (ML), which can be performed using JTT, WAG, Blosum62 (B62), RtREV and MtREV evolutionary models. Bayesian analysis was always performed using the evolutionary model that rendered the best likelihood in the ML analysis.

Bayesian analysis was always performed using the evolutionary model that rendered the best likelihood in the ML analysis. Inspired by the success of the information standard for microarray analyses (MIAMA), the need for a similar minimum information about a phylogenetic analysis standard (MIAPA) has been suggested (16). Although the developing of MIAPA standards is still on progress, several general guidelines have been proposed (16). In accordance to these guidelines, PhylomeDB provides comprehensive information on the programs and parameters used for each step of the pipeline so that the phylogenetic reconstruction can be reproduced. Since the same phylogenetic pipeline is applied to all seed proteins in a phylome, such details are provided in the features page of the corresponding phylome. Moreover, all alignments and trees rendered by the phylogenetic pipeline are provided in standard newick and phylip formats, respectively. As soon as new guidelines and MIAPA standards are developed, these will be implemented in PhylomeDB. Besides phylogenetic trees and alignments, PhylomeDB provides tree-based orthology and paralogy predictions. These predictions are generated from the seed sequence by mapping duplication and speciation events on the tree as determined by a species-overlap algorithm (3). In contrast to alternative, phylogeny-based methods that use reconciliation of the gene tree with the species tree, the PhylomeDB algorithm uses the level of overlap in the species connected to two related nodes to decide whether their parental node represents a duplication or speciation event. Briefly, the algorithm visits all nodes that connect the seed protein to the root of the tree and marks it as a duplication event if one or more species are shared by its two children nodes. Visualization of phylogenetic trees: different views of the ML phylogenetic tree, using JTT evolutionary model, for the seed protein (Hsa0017176), as displayed by the environment for tree exploration tool (ETE). Trees can be represented in rectangular (A), circular (B) or radial (C) modes. Several information labels such as support values or branch distances (A) can be displayed on nodes and edges, which can also be colored to indicate different evolutionary event. In (A) an example is shown where the lineages leading to the seed protein (Hsa0017176) are colored in blue or red to mark duplications and speciation events, respectively. This feature is shown after running the orthology prediction algorithm by clicking on the &#x2018;orthologs&#x2019; icon. Using the ETE toolbar (icons on the top of the section A), the user can navigate within the tree and browse it using different visualization options.

All protein sequences included in PhylomeDB are given a unique alpha-numeric ID (PhylomeID), which includes a three-letters code designating the species, followed by a sequential number. Codes for the 443 organisms included in PhylomeDB are listed in the features page of the corresponding phylomes. Correspondence between PhylomeIDs and IDs from external databases such as Swissprot and Ensembl are given in the corresponding sequence entries. Moreover, an ID converter tool provides the equivalences between Phylome ID and other selected IDs. PhylomeDB is publicly accessible at http://phylomedb.bioinfo.cipf.es. There are various ways in which users can access data stored in PhylomeDB. The database can be browsed by selecting a specific phylome from the home or content pages. In this case, a table appears that lists the entries to all the seed proteins included in the phylome. By clicking in a specific PhylomeID, the corresponding entry is shown. Each entry contains information on the seed protein and the homologous proteins included in the phylogenetic analysis together with the corresponding alignments and phylogenetic trees. Moreover, an ID text-based search is available for users to search for specific proteins by their PhylomeID, Swissprot or Ensembl IDs, among others, and, finally, the user can search using a specific protein sequence. In such case, a Smith&#x2013;Waterman search is performed against all seed proteins included in the database and the significant hits (e-value = 10&#x2212;3), with links to their entry pages, are displayed. Visualization of multiple sequence alignments: Example of the trimmed (clean) multiple sequence alignment of the example entry (Hsa0017176) as displayed by JalView (17). Sequence names are indicated by PhylomeID names, which include the three-letters species code followed by a number. The levels of sequence conservation and quality of each column, as well as a consensus sequence are indicated bellow. Colors, sequence format and visualization options can be changed using JalView interface.

PhylomeDB entries can be easily linked to from external pages using the following URL scheme: http://phylomedb.bioinfo.cipf.es/index.html?Hsapiens001&amp;Hsa0000001 to link to the entry Hsa0000001 of Hsapiens001 phylome. In this manner, protein databases not specifically focused in phylogenetic information can provide links to the phylogenies of their proteins. In summary, PhylomeDB has been developed as a database for storing and querying complete collections of gene phylogenies for complete genomes. We are continuing to expand the PhylomeDB database to incorporate data from other model species using the pipeline described above. We encourage other groups to contact us in order to suggest new phylomes to be generated or to submit phylomes generated with similar procedures. In any case, only phylomes that have been reconstructed following similar high-quality procedures will be stored in PhylomeDB. New enhancements that we are focusing on for the short- to medium-term include the following: (i) increase links to other external databases providing additional information such as functional annotation; (ii) provide enriched newick format with information on the nodes such as labels for speciation and duplication events and (iii) implement a topology search tool so that trees can be searched for the presence of a given topology. A new release of PhylomeDB is expected on a yearly basis.
