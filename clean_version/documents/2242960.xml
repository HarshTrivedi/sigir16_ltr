 Our cover illustration for the February 2006 issue was a departure from the custom of our first year. An artful assembly of the best in crystal photomicrographs submitted by authors of crystallization communications in 2005 replaced the &#x2019;molecule of the month&#x2019;.  Crystallization communications are a major component of our scientific content and we are pleased to acknowledge that on our cover. For next year and in the future, the cover of our January issue will be composed of crystal pictures that have appeared in our pages in the previous year.  For 2005, the editorial staff nominated and selected the pictures we used. This year, we ask authors to nominate photographs of crystals themselves.  If you would like one of your photographs considered as part of the crystals cover for 2007, please alert our Technical Editor, Louise Jones (lj@iucr.org) by e-mail.  This nomination process must be completed by December 1, 2006 in order to be able to assemble the final collage in time for the January issue.  Selection factors will include the technical quality of the images, focus, contrast, color and symmetry, but, in the final assembly, the photographs will be chosen to complement one another. We look forward to receiving your suggestions.
