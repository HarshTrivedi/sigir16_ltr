  <title>The pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics knowledge base: accentuating the knowledge
</title>
  <abstract>
 PharmGKB is a knowledge base that captures the relationships between drugs, diseases/phenotypes and genes involved in pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). This information includes literature annotations, primary data sets, PK and PD pathways, and expert-generated summaries of PK/PD relationships between drugs, diseases/phenotypes and genes. PharmGKB's website is designed to effectively disseminate knowledge to meet the needs of our users. PharmGKB currently has literature annotations documenting the relationship of over 500 drugs, 450 diseases and 600 variant genes. In order to meet the needs of whole genome studies, PharmGKB has added new functionalities, including browsing the variant display by chromosome and cytogenetic locations, allowing the user to view variants not located within a gene. We have developed new infrastructure for handling whole genome data, including increased methods for quality control and tools for comparison across other data sources, such as dbSNP, JSNP and HapMap data. PharmGKB has also added functionality to accept, store, display and query high throughput SNP array data. These changes allow us to capture more structured information on phenotypes for better cataloging and comparison of data. PharmGKB is available at www.pharmgkb.org

 The Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB; www.pharmgkb.org) is a public resource that promotes research into the relationships between human genotypes, phenotypes and clinical outcomes by linking and annotating primary data sets from ongoing research and established data from the literature (1,2). In addition to gene&#x2013;drug relationships, the PharmGKB also contains data on gene variation, genomics, gene&#x2013;disease relationships, drug action and pathways. The PharmGKB has developed highly curated pathways documenting the genes involved in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a selection of drugs. We have developed an XML format for defining genotype data, a relational database schema for data storage and a flexible mechanism for submitting phenotype data (3). We are also participating in the PML effort to define an XML standard for genotype/phenotype data exchange. PharmGKB first came online in April 2000, and major updates to the user interface appeared in 2002, 2004 and 2006. PharmGKB data and knowledge are updated on a continuous basis. Access is free but requires users to register for a username and password for viewing individual subject data. PharmGKB disseminates highly curated pharmacogenomic knowledge in a form that matches user needs. PharmGKB disseminates highly curated pharmacogenomic knowledge in a form that matches user needs. PharmGKB VariantPage. CYP2D6 variant page contains information on the variants within the gene boundaries. SNP array data are integrated with traditional PharmGKB primary data and other external variant data, such as dbSNP and JSNP. PharmGKB VariantPage.

PharmGKB Irinotecan Pathway. View of a model human liver cell showing blood, bile, and intestinal compartments, indicating tissue-specific involvement of genes in the irinotecan pathway. Drugs are depicted by purple boxes, transporter genes by turquoise ovals and genes coding for metabolic enzymes by blue ovals.

We allow reference addition to PharmGKB either as a Publication entry or as a Literature Annotation, which includes additional hand-curated details about the reference and the pharmacogenomic relationships described in the article. To aid users, PharmGKB knowledge generation is achieved by combining highly searchable controlled vocabulary classifications of references with brief, detailed free-text descriptions of the primary research findings. This provides users with the most flexible access to the knowledge we generate about the references, depending on their different needs and preferences. PharmGKB houses a variety of phenotype data sets. All phenotype submissions are accepted and PharmGKB has expanded submission methods to include Microsoft Office documents, or alternatively, a URL to another established archival public database (e.g. GEO). High-impact phenotype data sets are curated by hand, while others receive minimal oversight at PharmGKB. High-impact phenotype data sets correspond to genotype data submitted to PharmGKB and are typically published in peer-review journals. These data are featured on the PharmGKB website with an interactive display, curated annotations and downloadable Excel files. All phenotype files on PharmGKB are fully text-searchable. PharmGKB also offers links to web sites with controlled vocabularies in order to encourage investigators to optimize documentation of their deposits. PharmGKB phenotype data set. PharmGKB displays phenotype data. In the figure, there are five tabs: (i) Overview presents key indexing terms and a summary of the file, (ii) Publications points to key publication summaries, (iii) Column Headers defines the data present in the file and (iv) Individualized Data provides a data browser to look at the primary data. (v) External Data Links point to external data sources relevant to the data set, such as exon arrays stored in other databases. PharmGKB phenotype data set. PharmGKB displays phenotype data.

PharmGKB catalyzes the generation of new knowledge in pharmacogenomics through the development, implementation and dissemination of a public resource focused on both data and knowledge. In the short-term, this resource will facilitate basic research. In the long-term, it will impact how medicine is delivered. Our future work focuses on detailed annotation of individual human polymorphisms (or haplotypes) that are important for drug response phenotypes. We also are active in creating consortia of investigators interested in pooling pharmacogenomic data sets in order to improve population coverage and statistical power.
