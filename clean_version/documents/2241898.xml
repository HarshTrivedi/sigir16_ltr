  <title>2&#x2032;-Methylseleno-modified oligoribonucleotides for X-ray crystallography synthesized by the ACE RNA solid-phase approach
</title>
  <abstract>
 Site-specifically modified 2&#x2032;-methylseleno RNA represents a valuable derivative for phasing of X-ray crystallographic data. Several successful applications in three-dimensional structure determination of nucleic acids, such as the Diels&#x2013;Alder ribozyme, have relied on this modification. Here, we introduce synthetic routes to 2&#x2032;-methylseleno phosphoramidite building blocks of all four standard nucleosides, adenosine, cytidine, guanosine and uridine, that are tailored for 2&#x2032;-O-bis(acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE) RNA solid-phase synthesis. We additionally report on their incorporation into oligoribonucleotides including deprotection and purification. The methodological expansion of 2&#x2032;-methylseleno labeling via ACE RNA chemistry is a major step to make Se-RNA generally accessible and to receive broad dissemination of the Se-approach for crystallographic studies on RNA. Thus far, preparation of 2&#x2032;-methylseleno-modified oligoribonucleotides has been restricted to the 2&#x2032;-O-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl (TOM) and 2&#x2032;-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) RNA synthesis methods.

 Se-modified RNA for X-ray crystallography. (a) 2&#x2032;-Methylseleno-modified RNA represents a highly requested derivative for RNA crystallography. (b) A single crystal with an anomalous scattering center such as selenium is required during X-ray structure determination using advanced techniques for phase determination, such as MAD, SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) or SIRAS (single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering). (c) Solid-phase synthesis of 2&#x2032;-methylseleno RNA has been developed based on 5&#x2032;-O-(4,4&#x2032;-dimethoxytrityl) (DMT)-2&#x2032;-O-silyl protected nucleoside building blocks. (d) Goal of the present study is the synthesis of 2&#x2032;-methylseleno RNA by 2&#x2032;-O-bis(acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE) RNA solid-phase synthesis. For this, novel building blocks and adaptation of the established ACE solid-phase synthesis cycle are required. Se-modified RNA for X-ray crystallography.

(d) Goal of the present study is the synthesis of 2&#x2032;-methylseleno RNA by 2&#x2032;-O-bis(acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE) RNA solid-phase synthesis. For this, novel building blocks and adaptation of the established ACE solid-phase synthesis cycle are required. In the present work, we report on preparation of oligoribonucleotides with site-specific 2&#x2032;-methylseleno groups based on the 2&#x2032;-O-bis(acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE) RNA solid-phase synthesis method. Nucleoside phosphoramidites providing a fluorine-labile silyl protecting group at the ribose 5&#x2032;-OH and the acid-labile orthoester protecting group at the ribose 2&#x2032;-OH were introduced for chemical RNA synthesis in the late nineties (19). Within a very short time, this innovative strategy turned out to be highly competitive to commonly used RNA synthesis methods based on 5&#x2032;-O 4,4&#x2032;-dimethoxytritylated (DMT) nucleoside building blocks and laid the basis for one of the largest custom RNA synthesis services today. In particular, the very good quality of ACE oligoribonucleotides that are commercially available contributed to the high reputation of the method. In research laboratories, usage of the ACE RNA approach has been limited (20&#x2013;22) and is generally considered complex because of non-standard instrumentation, a long optimization period, and not least because of high costs when compared to the 5&#x2032;-O-DMT methods. Under the aspect that our previously established concept of selenium-modified RNA for X-ray structure analysis would strongly benefit from compatibility with high-quality ACE RNA synthesis, we put great efforts into the adaptation of this approach for the preparation of 2&#x2032;-methylseleno containing oligoribonucleotides. We show here that such derivatives are readily available via the novel nucleoside phosphoramidite building blocks and ACE RNA solid-phase synthesis procedures outlined subsequently. 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 300&#x2009;MHz, or Varian Unity 500&#x2009;MHz instrument. The chemical shifts are reported relative to TMS and referenced to the residual proton signal of the deuterated solvents: CDCl3 (7.26&#x2009;p.p.m.), d6-DMSO (2.49&#x2009;p.p.m.) for 1H-NMR spectra; CDCl3 (77.0&#x2009;p.p.m.) or d6-DMSO (39.5&#x2009;p.p.m.) for 13C-NMR spectra. 31P-shifts are relative to external 85% phosphoric acid. 1H- and 13C-assignments were based on COSY and HSQC experiments. UV-spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on silica 60F-254 plates. Flash column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 60 (230&#x2013;400 mesh or 70&#x2013;230 mesh). All reactions were carried out under argon atmosphere. Chemical reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Benzhydryloxy-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)chlorosilane (BzHCl) was obtained from Dharmacon. Organic solvents for reactions were dried overnight over freshly activated molecular sieves (4&#x2009;&#xC5;). To a suspension of adenosine A1 (1.0&#x2009;g; 3.742&#x2009;mmol) in DMF (12&#x2009;ml) and pyridine (12&#x2009;ml), 1,3-dichloro-1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyldisiloxane (1.3&#x2009;g; 4.116&#x2009;mmol) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 2&#x2009;h at room temperature, during which time it turned into a clear solution. Then, chlorotrimethylsilane (947&#x2009;&#xB5;l; 7.484&#x2009;mmol) was added and stirring was continued for 2&#x2009;h. The resulting white suspension was treated with acetyl chloride (292&#x2009;&#xB5;l; 4.116&#x2009;mmol) and stirred for 1.5&#x2009;h with occasional shaking. After completion of the reaction, the yellow solution was quenched by addition of 5% aqueous NaHCO3 and extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on SiO2 (CH2Cl2/CH3OH, 99.8/0.2 &#x2013; 99/1 v/v).

Then, the beads were removed from the column and additionally treated with DTT in H2O (150&#x2009;mM, 200&#x2009;&#xB5;l) for 1&#x2013;3&#x2009;h at room temperature in a 1.5&#x2009;ml vial. Cleavage from the solid support and deprotection of acyl groups was performed by MeNH2 in H2O (40%, 0.74&#x2009;ml) and DTT in H2O (2&#x2009;M, 60&#x2009;&#xB5;l; final DTT concentration 150&#x2009;mM). The mixture was heated to 60&#xB0;C and held at this temperature for 10&#x2009;min. Then, the solution was evaporated to dryness, and removal of 2&#x2032;-O-orthoesters was accomplished by treatment with N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) acetate buffer (100&#x2009;mM, 1&#x2009;mL, pH 3.8) for 30&#x2009;min at 60&#xB0;C. The mixture was evaporated to dryness, the residue dissolved in H2O (0.7&#x2009;ml), and the solution loaded on a size exclusion column (Amersham HiPrep 26/10 Desalting; 2.6&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10&#x2009;cm; Sephadex G25). The crude RNA was eluted with H2O and dried. Analysis of crude RNA products after deprotection was performed by anion-exchange chromatography on a Dionex DNAPac100 column (4&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;250&#x2009;mm) at 80&#xB0;C. Flow rate: 1&#x2009;ml/min; eluant A: 25&#x2009;mM Tris&#x2013;HCl (pH 8.0), 6&#x2009;M urea; eluant B: 25&#x2009;mM Tris&#x2013;HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5&#x2009;M NaClO4, 6&#x2009;M urea; gradient: 0&#x2013;60% B in A within 45&#x2009;min; UV-detection at 265&#x2009;nm. Crude RNA products were purified on a semi-preparative Dionex DNAPac100 column (9&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;250&#x2009;mm). Flow rate: 2&#x2009;ml/min; gradient: &#x394;5&#x2013;10% B in A within 20&#x2009;min. Fractions containing RNA were loaded on a C18 SepPak cartridge (Waters/Millipore), washed with 0.1&#x2013;0.2&#x2009;M (Et3NH)HCO3, H2O, and eluted with H2O/CH3CN (6/4). RNA fractions were lyophilized. All experiments were performed on a Finnigan LCQ Advantage MAX ion trap instrumentation connected to an Amersham Ettan micro LC system. RNAs were analyzed in the negative-ion mode with a potential of &#x2212;4&#x2009;kV applied to the spray needle. LC: Sample (250 pmol RNA dissolved in 30&#x2009;&#xB5;l of 20&#x2009;mM EDTA solution; average injection volume: 25&#x2013;30&#x2009;&#xB5;l); column (XTerra&#xAE;MS, C18 2.5&#x2009;&#xB5;m; 1.0&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;50&#x2009;mm) at 21&#xB0;C; flow rate: 30&#x2009;&#xB5;l/min; eluant A: 8.6&#x2009;mM TEA, 100&#x2009;mM 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol in H2O (pH 8.0); eluant B: methanol; gradient: 0&#x2013;100% B in A within 30&#x2009;min; UV-detection at 254&#x2009;nm. Prior to each injection, column equilibration was performed by eluting buffer A for 30&#x2009;min at a flow rate of 30&#x2009;&#xB5;l/min. The ACE method for chemical synthesis of RNA was designed under the aspect that mildly acidic aqueous conditions are most desirable for the final 2&#x2032;-O deprotection of the synthesized RNA (19). The loss of orthogonality in combination with the classic 5&#x2032;-O-DMT group was an obstacle to using a mildly acid-labile 2&#x2032;-O protecting group and thus, the concept was achieved based on the fluoride labile 5&#x2032;-O-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)cyclododecyloxysilyl ether (DOD), together with the 2&#x2032;-O-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE) orthoester. The 3&#x2032;-OH group was derivatized as methyl-N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite, since the cyanoethyl group turned out to be unstable with fluoride reagents. After oligonucleotide assembly, the phosphate methyl protecting groups were removed with disodium 2-carbamoyl-2-cyanoethylene-1,1-dithiolate trihydrate in DMF. Then, basic conditions (40% aqueous MeNH2) caused oligonucleotide cleavage from the solid support, along with the removal of the acyl protecting groups at the exocyclic amino groups and, importantly, of the acetyl groups at the 2&#x2032;-orthoesters. The resulting 2&#x2032;-O-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl orthoesters being 10 times more acid labile than prior to the removal of the acetyl groups, therefore required very mild acidic conditions (pH 3.8, 30&#x2009;min, 60&#xB0;C) for the final deprotection step (9,19,23&#x2013;25). For preparation of Se-modified RNA oligonucleotides based on the ACE method, we have elaborated the syntheses of appropriate nucleoside phosphoramidites as described subsequently.

For X-ray structure analysis, we consider RNA with covalent 2&#x2032;-methylseleno groups best applicable for sizes up to about 80&#x2009;nt. Se-RNA of this dimension can be readily obtained by solid-phase synthesis in combination with enzymatic ligation procedures (4,29,30). For RNAs up to about 35&#x2009;nt, the Se-approach is in competition with 5-iodo and 5-bromo pyrimidine derivatization (31&#x2013;37). We render the Se-approach superior since all four 2&#x2032;-methylseleno nucleoside phosphoramidites are available, and therefore a great flexibility for adequate positioning within the RNA target is attained. This is important since the Se-labels should always be placed in double helical regions of a complex fold to minimize structural perturbance (5). In addition, 5-halogen pyrimidine derivatives are highly photo-reactive species (38&#x2013;40). Inherent radiation damage of 5-halogen-modified nucleic acids during MAD data collection has been reported as a limitation (35). For medium-size RNA (up to 100&#x2009;nt), the Se-approach competes with heavy metal ion derivatization (41&#x2013;44). Search for a suitable heavy atom is a time-consuming process which requires soaking of the RNA crystals with dozens of compounds at various concentrations, therefore demanding many reasonably good crystals. This can be a serious obstacle, as had been encountered for the Diels&#x2013;Alder ribozyme where the Se-approach finally delivered the key derivative to enable structure determination (16). Moreover, we have recently shown that 2&#x2032;-methylseleno-modified model duplexes gave crystals in many more buffer conditions compared to their unmodified counterparts, and thus Se-modifications hold promise to actively support the crystallization process (6). In the present study, we have shown that highly requested, 2&#x2032;-methylseleno-functionalized RNA that represents a key derivative for RNA crystallography, is readily accessible by the ACE synthesis protocols elaborated here. The study further shows that the methodological transfer to ACE-based synthesis is not only feasible but highly satisfying since the quality of the modified Se-RNAs can well compete with the quality of TOM-made Se-RNA. We are convinced that this new access to 2&#x2032;-methylseleno RNA will contribute to a fast dissemination of the Se-approach for RNA X-ray structure analysis.
