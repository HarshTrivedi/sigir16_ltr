  <title>PBmice: an integrated database system of piggyBac (PB) insertional mutations and their characterizations in mice
</title>
  <abstract>
 DNA transposon piggyBac (PB) is a newly established mutagen for large-scale mutagenesis in mice. We have designed and implemented an integrated database system called PBmice (PB Mutagenesis Information CEnter) for storing, retrieving and displaying the information derived from PB insertions (INSERTs) in the mouse genome. This system is centered on INSERTs with information including their genomic locations and flanking genomic sequences, the expression levels of the hit genes, and the expression patterns of the trapped genes if a trapping vector was used. It also archives mouse phenotyping data linked to INSERTs, and allows users to conduct quick and advanced searches for genotypic and phenotypic information relevant to a particular or a set of INSERT(s). Sequence-based information can be cross-referenced with other genomic databases such as Ensembl, BLAST and GBrowse tools used in PBmice offer enhanced search and display for additional information relevant to INSERTs. The total number and genomic distribution of PB INSERTs, as well as the availability of each PB insertional LINE can also be viewed with user-friendly interfaces. PBmice is freely available at http://www.idmshanghai.cn/PBmice or http://www.scbit.org/PBmice/.

 Large-scale mutagenesis is critical to functional characterization of the mammalian genomes. In mice, gene targeting, chemical mutagenesis and insertional mutagenesis are available to achieve this goal. The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has recently been formed to systematically produce null alleles for individual genes in mice (1&#x2013;3). This approach focuses on annotated protein-coding regions but provides limited insight into the rest of the genome. In contrast, ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) based chemical mutagenesis has the capacity to introduce mutations throughout the entire genome (4&#x2013;11). Several large-scale ENU mutagenesis studies have been conducted in the recent years and produced a large collection of mutant mice with interesting phenotypes. However, the majority of these mutant strains remain to be mapped to the single gene level. Insertional mutagenesis has been shown to be one of the most efficient means to generate a large number of identifiable mutants throughout the entire genome of several model organisms (12&#x2013;17). With an appropriate insertion vector, insertional mutagenesis can produce a large number of mutations at low cost with a high speed. Each insertion site is tagged with the vector sequence and thus can be easily mapped. Retroviruses have been used in mouse genetics for more than two decades (18,19). They led to discovery of a number of proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor loci (19). However, successful application of retroviruses in large-scale insertional mutagenesis remains limited to gene trapping in ES cells (20,21). In recent years, the progress of introducing transposon tools into mammalian genetic studies has offered new opportunities for mutagenesis in mice (22&#x2013;30). Several transposons, such as Sleeping Beauty (SB), Minos, Tol2, Mos1 and piggyBac (PB), were shown to be active in mammalian cells and/or in mice. Among them, the PB transposon appears to be a promising option. Appreciation of PB as an important genetic manipulation tool in various organisms including mice has been growing rapidly in recent years, as accumulating evidence has indicated that PB elements are capable of efficient transposition in animals from diverse genera of insects, flatworms, mice, as well as mammalian cell lines (28,29,31&#x2013;38). PB elements, originally found in the cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni, are DNA transposons carrying a unique functional transposase (PBase) of 594 amino acids (39&#x2013;41). It has been reported to be more active than Tol2, Mos1 and SB in mammalian cells (30), and has been shown to be effective mutagen for insertional mutagenesis in mice. Currently, a genome-wide PB mutagenesis project is underway in the Institute of Developmental Biology and Molecular Medicine (IDM) at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. To collect and disseminate the large amount of genetic and phenotypic information from this project, we have designed and implemented an integrated database system called PBmice (PB Mutagenesis Information CEnter), which provides a user interface to query and display data obtained from PB insertions (INSERTs) in the mouse genome and their characterizations. Experimental data in PBmice are derived from the on-going project of PB insertional mutagenesis in mice at IDM. Each PB transposition event produces a PB insertion, which is termed as an INSERT in PBmice and carried by a mouse line (LINE). The flanking genomic sequence of an INSERT is characterized by inverse PCR and determined for its location in the mouse genome by WU-BLAST 2.0 search against the Ensembl mouse genome sequences (Ensembl release 45, based on GenBank m36 mouse assembly, http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/index.html) (42). Expression level of the gene hit by an INSERT is determined by real-time RT-PCR. Other information about the INSERT, such as the mouse strain and LINE carrying the INSERT and the PB construct used to generate the INSERT, are also collected in the database. When a trapping vector is used to generate the INSERT, the expression pattern of the reporter gene of the vector, an indication of the expression pattern of the endogenous gene affected in the INSERT, is also examined and collected in the database. Associated information of a LINE carrying one or more INSERTs includes the existence of live animals and storage status, as well as its phenotyping data. When an INSERT hits a functional genomic unit, such as an annotated protein-coding gene, a gene for a microRNA, or a regulatory element, this interruption of genomic function may be shown as phenotypes in the hosting LINE. Such characterizations are also recorded and documented in PBmice. In addition, other information, such as gene annotation data, is downloaded from Ensembl and GenBank. A Java tool has been developed for PBmice to integrate gene data from Ensembl and GenBank are incorporated together. MGI-ID of a gene is used to integrate the information of the same gene downloaded from Ensembl and GenBank in PBmice. Gene information contains gene names with synonyms, descriptions, genomic locations, transcript information and IDs linked to existing databases, such as Ensembl, GenBank and Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) (http://www.informatics.jax.org/), for links to its detailed information in those databases. Additionally, users can obtain protein information from ExPASy (http://us.expasy.org/) and gene function information from the Gene Ontology Database (http://www.geneontology.org/). The integrated items are converted into data files in GFF format (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF/) for retrieving and displaying with GBrowse (http://www.gmod.org/wiki/index.php/Gbrowse), allowing for a more straightforward and user-friendly view. INSERTs and INSERT-related data form the central core of PBmice. This system provides detailed information about an INSERT and associated information of the LINE carrying the INSERT and the gene hit by the INSERT. Search interfaces. (a) The Quick Search interface.

BLAST and GBrowse tools are provided for enhanced search and user-friendly access to additional information relevant to each INSERT. The BLAST tool allows users access to any INSERT that hits into a mouse genomic DNA fragment of interest with the sequence information of this DNA fragment. The GBrowse tool offers users not only a simple and direct view of the genomic location of any INSERT in PBmice and the annotation of the mouse genome with user-defined criteria, but also links to the INSERT Detail interface in PBmice and the Gene Report interface in Ensembl. The Statistics interface presents the total number and distribution of INSERTs on the mouse chromosomes. A pie chart categorizes the genomic locations of all INSERTs into introns, exons, intergenic regions or ND (undetermined). Introduction and step-by-step search examples are provided in the Help interface of PBmice. PBmice is freely available at http://www.idmshanghai.cn/PBmice, or http://www.scbit.org/PBmice/. It is maintained by the IDM at Fudan University. All data sources used by PBmice are reviewed and updated quarterly. During the next 3 years, development of this system will include: (i) new INSERTs will be released from the on-going genome-wide PB mutagenesis project that aims to create 10 000 insertions in mice; (ii) corresponding changes will be made following any substantial change in the mouse genome sequence information from new releases of linked databases such as Ensembl. In particular, the position of the existing INSERTs will be remapped with a new round of Blast search to provide updated information for users; (iii) a dynamic data management system will be incorporated into PBmice so that collaborators have the opportunities to access to primary data prior to its release and (iv) a policy and practical mechanism will be developed to allow dissemination of mutant strains and relevant reagents for non-profit academic research.
