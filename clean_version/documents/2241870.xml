  <title>Repair of DNA double-strand breaks within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence results in frequent deletion of the triplet-repeat sequence
</title>
  <abstract>
 Friedreich ataxia is caused by an expanded (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence, which is unstable during intergenerational transmission and in most patient tissues, where it frequently undergoes large deletions. We investigated the effect of DSB repair on instability of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence. Linear plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli so that each colony represented an individual DSB repair event. Repair of a DSB within the repeat resulted in a dramatic increase in deletions compared with circular templates, but DSB repair outside the repeat tract did not affect instability. Repair-mediated deletions were independent of the orientation and length of the repeat, the location of the break within the repeat or the RecA status of the strain. Repair at the center of the repeat resulted in deletion of approximately half of the repeat tract, and repair at an off-center location produced deletions that were equivalent in length to the shorter of the two repeats flanking the DSB. This is consistent with a single-strand annealing mechanism of DSB repair, and implicates erroneous DSB repair as a mechanism for genetic instability of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence. Our data contrast significantly with DSB repair within (CTG&#x2022;CAG)n repeats, indicating that repair-mediated instability is dependent on the sequence of the triplet repeat.

 Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is one of over 20 neurodegenerative diseases caused by the expansion of a triplet-repeat sequence (1&#x2013;3). Whereas all other triplet-repeat diseases are caused by either expanded (CTG&#x2022;CAG)n or (CCG&#x2013;CGG)n sequences, FRDA is caused by an expanded (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence located in the first intron of the FXN gene (previously known as X25) (4). This (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence is polymorphic; alleles with &lt;33 triplets do not cause disease, whereas alleles with &gt;65 triplets are disease causing (4&#x2013;6). The expanded (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence inhibits transcription of the FXN gene, most likely by forming a stable secondary structure such as a triplex or sticky DNA (7&#x2013;10), which produces a deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin (11). The levels of mature FXN transcript and frataxin protein in patient cells is inversely correlated with the length of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence (11,12), and therefore, disease severity, including the age of onset and several other clinical features, directly correlate with repeat length (13&#x2013;15). The (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence within the FXN gene is genetically unstable. The length of the repeat tract often changes during intergenerational transmission (15&#x2013;17). The expanded repeat almost always contracts (by &#x223C;20&#x2013;30%) via paternal transmission, but shows an equal tendency for expansion or contraction during maternal transmission. The expanded (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence also displays somatic instability. In the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which is the primary site of pathology in FRDA patients, there is a tendency for the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence to undergo further expansion (18). Interestingly, there is an accumulation of these expansions over time, which suggests that these expansions could contribute to the development of the progressive, tissue-specific phenotype in FRDA (18). However, in contrast to DRG, all other human tissues display a marked contraction bias (18). In peripheral blood cells and in sperm, the expanded repeat tract may even revert back to the normal size range (17,19). Since FRDA is an autosomal recessive disease, the majority of the disease-causing expanded alleles are inherited via asymptomatic heterozygous carriers of expanded (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n alleles. Indeed, de novo expansion from premutation alleles (with 34&#x2013;65 triplets) is rare, and disease prevalence is mostly maintained via the existence of a large number of asymptomatic heterozygous carriers (5,6). Given that disease severity correlates with the length of the inherited expanded allele, and the repeat tract has a natural tendency for large contractions in most human tissues, understanding the mechanisms that cause large contractions may help in developing therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing down or preventing the progressive accumulation of large expansions in DRG. The mechanisms responsible for triplet-repeat instability are only partially understood. Recombination (20&#x2013;23), DNA repair (24&#x2013;26) and epigenetic modification (27) have all been implicated. Our lab, along with others, has demonstrated that DNA replication can also mediate triplet-repeat instability. The orientation of the (CTG&#x2022;CAG)n, (CGG&#x2022;CCG)n and (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n repeat tract relative to the origin of replication in bacteria and yeast influences instability (28&#x2013;33). Furthermore, plasmid replication in transiently transfected mammalian cells in culture was a prerequisite for instability of the (CTG&#x2022;CAG)n and (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n repeats, with both the orientation of the repeat tract and its distance from the origin of replication acting as significant modifiers (34,35). The (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence has been shown to stall replication fork progression, and this occurs specifically when (GAA)n is the template for lagging strand synthesis (36&#x2013;39). Stalling of replication forks may result in a double-strand break (DSB) (40&#x2013;42). Others have shown that repair of a DSB near or within a (CTG&#x2022;CAG)n or (CGG&#x2022;CCG)n sequence results in orientation-dependent repeat instability and/or the deletion of flanking sequence. Furthermore, the instability they observed following DSB repair significantly increased in the absence of the RecA protein (43&#x2013;46). We recently found that in the absence of RecA, (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n instability was significantly increased specifically when GAA served as the lagging strand template (47). Since the role of DSB repair in mediating (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n instability is unknown, we investigated whether repair of a synthetic DSB within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence would influence repeat instability. We discovered that while DSB repair immediately outside of a (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence had no effect on repeat instability, DSB repair within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence dramatically increased instability. Indeed, almost every single repair event resulted in deletion of the repeat tract. We also found that the high level of instability was RecA-independent. Interestingly, the location of the DSB within the repeat tract significantly influenced the size of the deletion, consistent with a single-strand annealing mechanism by which DSB repair causes contractions of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence. The absence of any dependence on the length and orientation of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n repeat, the presence/absence of RecA, and no obvious deletions involving the sequence flanking the triplet repeat, contrasts significantly with observation previously made with the (CTG&#x2022;CAG)n sequence. Our results provide a potential mechanistic basis for the frequent deletions seen with the expanded (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence, and also highlight the dependence of the mechanism(s) of genetic instability on the sequence of the expanded triplet repeat. (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n constructs used to analyze effect of DSB repair on triplet-repeat instability. pUC19 based constructs are shown containing either uninterrupted (GAA&#x2022;TTC)79 or (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequences engineered to contain a XbaI recognition sequence at specific locations within the repeat tract (see Materials and Methods section for details). Repeat tracts were cloned in both orientations relative to the origin of replication (arrow indicates direction of replication). Repeat-containing plasmids are depicted either in the &#x2018;GAA orientation&#x2019; (e.g. GAA-79) or &#x2018;TTC&#x2019; orientation (e.g. TTC-79), based on whether (GAA)n or (TTC)n serves as the lagging strand template, respectively. Numbers within the boxes indicate the length of the uninterrupted (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence.

Numbers within the boxes indicate the length of the uninterrupted (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence. The GAA-70X construct, which contains the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)70 sequence with an XbaI site located exactly at the center of the repeat tract (Figure 1), was created using four synthetic oligonucleotides, as follows: Oligo #1: 5&#x2032;-GGCGCTCCGCTGCAGCC(GAA)35TCTAGACGCATCGCC-3&#x2032; and Oligo #2: 5&#x2032;GGCGATGCGTCTAGA(TTC)35GGCTGCAGCGGAGCGCC-3&#x2032; were annealed together in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and digestion buffer 3 (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) (New England Biolabs), followed by incubating with PstI and XbaI restriction enzymes to digest both ends of the annealed oligos. The purified insert was subcloned into the PstI and XbaI sites of pUC19, and confirmed by sequencing. Oligo #3: 5&#x2032;-GGCGCTCCGTCTAGA(GAA)35CCGGTACCCGCATCGCC-3&#x2032; and Oligo #4: 5&#x2032;-GGCGATGCGGGTACCGG(TTC)35TCTAGACGCATCGCC-3&#x2032;were annealed in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and digestion buffer 2 (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) (New England Biolabs), digested with XbaI and KpnI, and ligated into the similarly digested recombinant pUC19 vector containing the first (GAA&#x2022;TTC)35 insert in the PstI and XbaI restriction sites (described above). The length and purity of the resulting (GAA&#x2022;TTC)70 sequence with an XbaI site located at the center of the repeat tract were verified by sequencing. The GAA-30X construct, which contains a (GAA&#x2022;TTC)30 repeat sequence with an XbaI restriction site located exactly at the center of the repeat tract (Figure 1), was created using the two following synthetic oligos, which allowed the insertion of the appropriate sequence into the PstI and KpnI sites in pUC19, as described above: Oligo #5: 5&#x2032;-GGCGCTCCGCTGCAGCC(GAA)15TCTAGA(GAA)15GGGGTACCCGCATCGCC-3&#x2032;and Oligo #6: 5&#x2032;-GGCGATGCGGGTACCCC(TTC)15TCTAGA(TTC)15GGCTGCAGCGGAGCGCC-3&#x2032;. Plasmids containing the appropriate repeat insert were confirmed by sequencing. The GAA-35XGAA-15 construct has a (GAA&#x2022;TTC)35 sequence on one side of the XbaI restriction site in pUC19 (proximal to the ColE1 origin) and a (GAA&#x2022;TTC)15 sequence on the other side of the XbaI site (Figure 1). Oligos #1 and #2 were annealed as described above and digested with PstI and XbaI to generate the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)35 insert. Plasmid GAA-30X was digested with PstI and XbaI, releasing the intervening (GAA&#x2022;TTC)15 sequence, and the gel-purified vector was ligated with the similarly digested (GAA&#x2022;TTC)35 insert. The GAA-15XGAA-35 construct has a (GAA&#x2022;TTC)15 sequence on one side of the XbaI restriction site (proximal to the origin) and a (GAA&#x2022;TTC)35 sequence on the other side of the XbaI site (Figure 1). Oligos #3 and #4 were annealed as described previously and digested with XbaI and KpnI to generate a (GAA&#x2022;TTC)35 insert. Plasmid GAA-30X was digested with XbaI and KpnI, releasing the intervening (GAA&#x2022;TTC)15 sequence, and the resulting vector was ligated with the similarly digested (GAA&#x2022;TTC)35 insert. Plasmids containing the appropriate repeat insert were confirmed by sequencing. To create the corresponding TTC-70X, TTC-30X, TTC-35XTTC-15 and TTC-15XTTC-35 constructs (Figure 1), the orientation of the repeat tract within GAA-70X, GAA-30X, GAA-15XGAA-35 and GAA-35XGAA-15, respectively, was reversed. The constructs in the GAA orientation were digested with HindIII and EcoRI, which are located outside of the repeat tract. The 3&#x2032; recessed ends of the vectors and inserts were end-filled with Klenow polymerase. The vector and insert were separately gel-purified and the vector was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase, and ligations were set-up. Colony PCR with primers: DSBTTCtest-F: 5&#x2032;GCCAAGCTAATTCGAGCTCGGTACC-3&#x2032; and DSB-R (see below) was used to identify plasmids with repeat tracts in the desired TTC orientation. The sequence and orientation of the appropriate repeat inserts were verified by sequencing. The GAA-70-spacer construct was created by inserting a synthetic sequence with the following restriction sites &#x2018;XbaI&#x2013;NcoI&#x2013;BamHI&#x2013;XhoI&#x2013;XbaI&#x2019; into the XbaI site of GAA-70X. This effectively inserted a 28 bp spacer in between two tracts of GAA-35 (in the same orientation) that could be cut exactly in the center with BamHI. The following complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into a phosphatase-treated XbaI linearized GAA-70X vector to produce GAA-70-spacer: 5&#x2032;-GGCGCTCCGTCTAGACTCGAGGATCCATGGTTCTAGACGCATCGCC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GGCGATGCGTCTAGAACCATGGATCCTCGAGTCTAGACGGAGCGCC-3&#x2032;. Note: an extra &#x2018;A&#x2019; was added between the XbaI and NcoI sites in order to make BamHI cut in the center of the 28 bp spacer. Three micrograms of each plasmid construct was linearized with the appropriate enzyme (Figure 1; see Results section) to create synthetic DSBs, and isolated from any undigested plasmid by gel purification following electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. Linear DNA destined for use in future experiments was never exposed to ethidium bromide or UV irradiation. Southern blotting with a &#x3B3;-P32 end-labeled pUC19 probe (5&#x2032;-GCTGCAAGGCGATTAAGTTGG-3&#x2032;) was used to verify adequacy of isolation of linear DNA from supercoiled DNA. Moreover, the transformation efficiency of linearized DNA was &#x223C;100-fold less compared with the corresponding circular DNA. Isogenic Escherichia coli strains MM28 (galK2(OC) &#x3BB;&#x2212; IN(rrnD-rrnE)1 rpsL200(strR)) and M152 (recA3), and isogenic E. coli strains AB1157 (thr-1 araC14 leuB6(Am) DE(gpt-proA)62 lacY1 tsx-33 qsr&#x2019;0 lgnV44(As) galK2(Oc) LAM&#x2212; Rac-0 hisG4(Oc) rfbC1 mgl-51 rpoS396(Am) rpsL31(strR) kdgK51 xylA5 mtl-1 argE3(Oc) thi-1) and JC10287 (DE(recA-srlR)304) were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (Yale University). The MM28, M152, AB1157 and JC10287 strains were made &#x2018;ultra-competent&#x2019; using the Inoue method. Each transformation was performed using 5 ng of circular plasmid DNA or 25 ng of linearized plasmid DNA, followed by plating on LB-agar plates containing 100 &#x3BC;g/ml ampicillin. Since viability of cells transformed with linear constructs was dependent upon recircularization of the plasmid to provide ampicillin resistance, each colony therefore represented a DSB repair event. Transformation of each template was performed in triplicate and 50&#x2013;100 colonies were screened from each transformation. (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n instability was determined by colony PCR of transformants using primers DSB-F (5&#x2032;-ACAGCTATGACCATGATTACG-3&#x2032;) and DSB-R (5&#x2032;-GGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACG-3&#x2032;), which are located within the flanking pUC19 sequence (40 bp upstream and 56 bp downstream from the repeat tract, respectively). Instability was defined as the number of mutation events (repeat tracts of altered length) per successful colony (DSB repair event) screened. Repeat lengths were calculated by estimating sizes of PCR products on 2.5% agarose gels relative to a DNA size standard. Since all mutation events resulted in deletion of the repeat tract, the term instability is synonymous with deletion in these experiments. To determine whether the restriction site used to create the DSB was maintained following repair, PCR products representing deletions were digested with the restriction enzyme used to linearize the plasmid prior to transformation (HindIII and EcoRI for GAA-79, XbaI for GAA-70X, and BamHI for GAA-70-spacer). Products of digestion were run on 2.5% agarose gels alongside the original PCR product. Comparison of means was done using the independent samples t-test. Frequencies were compared using &#x3C7;2 analysis. Differences were considered significant when P &#x2264; 0.01. DSB repair results in dramatically increased instability of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence when the break is located within the repeat tract.

Arrowheads indicate the position of the full-length repeat tract. DSB repair outside the repeat tract showed levels of instability that were similar to the uncut plasmids; however, DSB repair within the repeat tract resulted in a very high frequency of deletions. The first lane in each gel contains the 1 kb Plus ladder (Invitrogen) with bands from the bottom of the gel representing 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.65 kb (note: the full-length products of GAA-79 and GAA-70X are 423 and 312 bp, respectively, due to the presence of some flanking intron 1 sequence from the human FXN gene in the former).

Arrowheads indicate the position of the full-length repeat tract. DSB repair outside the repeat tract showed levels of instability that were similar to the uncut plasmids; however, DSB repair within the repeat tract resulted in a very high frequency of deletions. Note that even the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)30 sequence, which was otherwise extremely stable, showed a dramatic rise in the frequency of deletions. The first lane of every gel contains a DNA size marker; the markers used in the gels containing repair products of templates GAA-30X PstI and KpnI are different from all other gels. The first lane in each gel contains either the 1 kb Plus ladder (Invitrogen) (GAA-30X; PstI and KpnI with bands from the bottom of the gel representing 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 kb, or the 50 bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen) (GAA-30X; uncut and XbaI) with bands from the bottom of the gel representing 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3 and 0.35 kb. (C) DSB repair within a slightly unstable (GAA&#x2022;TTC)70&#x2013;79 sequence produced a dramatic rise in instability. Note that the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence was equally unstable in the GAA and TTC orientations. (D) DSB repair within a highly stable (GAA&#x2022;TTC)30 sequence produced a dramatic rise in instability. Note that the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence was equally unstable in the GAA and TTC orientations. All error bars represent +/&#x2212;2 SEM derived from triplicate experiments.

(C) DSB repair within a slightly unstable (GAA&#x2022;TTC)70&#x2013;79 sequence produced a dramatic rise in instability. Note that the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence was equally unstable in the GAA and TTC orientations. (D) DSB repair within a highly stable (GAA&#x2022;TTC)30 sequence produced a dramatic rise in instability. Note that the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence was equally unstable in the GAA and TTC orientations. All error bars represent +/&#x2212;2 SEM derived from triplicate experiments. The sequence at the repair site was investigated by further digesting the deletion products obtained after DSB repair of the linearized templates, using the respective enzymes for the creation of the DSBs. Whereas all 63 products of the HindIII-digested GAA-79 construct, and all but one of the 61 EcoRI digested GAA-79 construct maintained their respective HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites, none of the 76 deletions from the XbaI digested GAA-70X construct had maintained the XbaI site. This indicates that the increased instability observed when DSB repair was made to occur within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence was due to the repair process itself, i.e., resulting from loss of DNA sequence at the break site. The lower level of instability observed with plasmids cut outside of the repeat tract must therefore have occurred either before the DSB was created or after the repair process itself. To determine whether the length of the repeat tract had any influence on DSB repair mediated instability, a (GAA&#x2022;TTC)30 sequence was similarly engineered with an XbaI restriction site located exactly at the center of the repeat tract, which was also cloned into pUC19 in both orientations relative to the origin of replication (GAA-30X and TTC-30X; Figure 1). The uncut GAA-30X and TTC-30X constructs were almost completely stable, as were the plasmids that underwent DSB repair just outside of the repeat tract (at PstI and KpnI; Figure 2D), and no significant difference was seen in the level of instability between the uncut and linearized plasmids in either the GAA or TTC orientations. However, DSB repair at the center of the repeat tract resulted in a significantly higher number of deletions than the uncut parental plasmid in both orientations (P &lt; 0.001), with no significant difference in instability between the GAA and TTC orientations (P = 0.39; Figure 2D). Despite the fact that the circular GAA-30X and TTC-30X plasmids were significantly more stable than the circular GAA-70X and TTC-70X plasmids (P = 0.01 and P = 0.005 for GAA and TTC, respectively), no difference was seen in the level of instability between the 70X and 30X constructs following DSB repair at the XbaI site, in either the GAA or TTC orientation (P = 0.59 and P = 0.35 for GAA and TTC, respectively). Essentially, most of the DSB repair events within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)30 sequence resulted in deletion of the repeat tract (Figure 2B and D). Therefore, neither the length nor the orientation of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence had any influence on the frequency of instability seen when DSB repair occurred within the repeat tract. The dramatic rise in instability of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence when DSB repair occurs within the repeat tract is independent of the nature of the termini being repaired. Repair of both the 3&#x2032; recessed XbaI termini (GAA-70X), and the same template after end filling with Klenow polymerase resulted in similar levels of instability. All error bars represent +/&#x2212;2 SEM derived from triplicate experiments.

All error bars represent +/&#x2212;2 SEM derived from triplicate experiments. DSB repair-mediated deletions involved the repeat tract per se and there was no indication of deletions involving the plasmid (non-repeat) sequence immediately flanking the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n repeat. Sequencing of several of the deletions obtained via repair of the XbaI site at the center of the repeat in the 70X and 30X constructs revealed only a shorter but pure (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence with no loss of sequence outside of the repeat tract. Moreover, the location of the DSB-F and DSB-R primers close to the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n repeat would entail that even relatively small deletions of the flanking sequence would be expected to result in failure of amplification of the repeat tract. However, this was not seen, indicating that there was no significant deletion of flanking non-repeat sequence. For example, the DSB-F and DSB-R primers are located 22/26 bp upstream and 39/43 bp downstream of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)30 repeat in the GAA-30X and TTC-30X constructs, respectively, and there was no difference in the ability to amplify the repeat tract from either the uncut [522/559 (93.4%) colonies], XbaI [669/705 (94.9%) colonies] or PstI [362/373 (97%) colonies] linearized vectors (P = 0.85). DSB repair mediated instability of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence is independent of RecA. (A) Repair of linear templates obtained by XbaI digestion of GAA-70X, TTC-70X, GAA-30X and TTC-30X resulted in similar levels of instability when transformed into E. coli MM28 [wild-type (WT)] and its isogenic recA mutant strain, M152. There was no difference in the level of repeat instability between the RecA-proficient and RecA-deficient strains, regardless of repeat length or the orientation with respect to the origin of replication. (B) Instability of GAA-30X constructs either uncut or following repair at the PstI, XbaI or KpnI restriction sites in isogenic E. coli strains AB1157 (RecA-proficient) and JC10287 (RecA-deficient) showing that DSB repair-mediated instability is independent of RecA. Note that there is no difference in the level of instability with any of the four constructs in AB1157 versus JC10287. DSB repair, when specifically within the repeat tract, causes significantly increased instability in both strains. All error bars represent +/&#x2212;2 SEM derived from triplicate experiments.

DSB repair at the center of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence results in the preferential deletion of approximately half (or less than half) of the total repeat length. The residual tract lengths of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence are shown (as a percentage of full-length) after transformation in E. coli MM28 of (A) EcoRI and HindIII linearized GAA-79 and TTC-79; (B) XbaI linearized GAA-70X and TTC-70X; (C) XbaI linearized GAA-30X and TTC-30X, (D) XbaI linearized (3&#x2032; recessed) and after end filling (blunt-ended) GAA-70X, (E) XbaI linearized GAA-30X in MM28 (RecA-proficient) and M152 (RecA-deficient) isogenic strains, and (F) XbaI linearized GAA-30X in AB1157 (RecA-proficient) and JC10287 (RecA-deficient) isogenic strains. Note that the size distribution of deletion products is random when DSB repair occurs outside the repeat (EcoRI, HindIII); however, approximately half of the repeat tract, or less, is preferentially deleted when DSB repair occurs at the center of the repeat tract. This is irrespective of the initial length of the repeat tract (70 or 30 triplets), the nature of the termini being repaired (staggered or blunt), or the presence/absence of RecA.

DSB repair-mediated instability of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence is independent of the length of the intervening sequence at the center of the repeat tract. (A) GAA-70-spacer construct containing a 28 bp spacer in the XbaI site of GAA-70X, such that BamHI would cut in the center of the spacer (indicated by the black box). (B) DSB repair at the BamHI site in GAA-70-spacer construct produced a dramatic rise in instability. Note that the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence was equally unstable when transformed into E. coli MM28 [wild-type (WT)] and its isogenic recA mutant strain, M152.

Repair of a DSB located off-center within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence preferentially results in deletions that are approximately equivalent to the length of the side with the shorter repeat tract. A (GAA&#x2022;TTC)50 sequence was linearized at an XbaI restriction site located at one of two locations off-center within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence such that there were 15 and 35 repeats on either side of the DSB. The residual repeat length of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence following DSB repair is shown as a percentage of the full-length repeat. The length distribution of the deletions show that the magnitude of the deletions were approximately equivalent to the shorter of the two sides of the repeat tract (&#x223C;15 repeats or 61&#x2013;80% of full-length), regardless of the location of the DSB within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence, or the orientation of the repeat tract with respect to the origin of replication.

The residual repeat length of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence following DSB repair is shown as a percentage of the full-length repeat.

FRDA is exceptional among a growing number of diseases caused by triplet-repeat expansions, in being inherited as a recessive trait (4). Therefore, while most other triplet-repeat diseases are frequently the result of de novo intergenerational expansions, FRDA is most commonly caused by inheriting fully expanded (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n alleles from both parents. All expanded triplet-repeat sequences are somatically unstable; however, while (CNG)n repeats (the sequence associated with most such diseases) display an expansion bias in all human tissues (48&#x2013;51), the expanded (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n repeat displays a strong contraction bias in almost all tissues (18,19,52). The (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence has been shown to stall replication fork progression specifically when (GAA)n is the lagging strand template (39). We recently found that a deficiency of the RecA-dependent RecFOR and RecBCD pathways for restart of stalled replication forks results in orientation-dependent instability, with increased instability specifically when (GAA)n is the lagging strand template (47). These data indicate that the pathways for restart of stalled replication forks can result in stabilization of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence in the GAA orientation. However, another possible consequence of replication stalling is the generation of DSBs (40&#x2013;42). Therefore, it was of interest to us to determine what effect repairing DSBs near or within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence might have on repeat instability. Here we show that while DSB repair outside of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence had no effect on the level of instability, repairing a DSB within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence resulted in a dramatic increase in frequency of deletions. Indeed, almost every repair event resulted in a partial deletion of the repeat tract. Additionally, abolition of the restriction sequence at the site of the repair indicated that the repair process itself was responsible for the loss of triplet-repeat sequence. Our observations are in sharp contrast with those made by others using the (CTG&#x2022;CAG)n sequence (44). We noted that virtually all DSB repair events within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence resulted in deletions. Moreover, our results did not depend on the length or orientation of the repeat tract, nor on the RecA status of the strain used. In contrast, others found that DSB repair within the (CTG&#x2022;CAG)n sequence resulted in deletions that were dependent on the length and orientation of the repeat tract, and moreover that recA mutants showed enhanced deletion frequency (44). Furthermore, when DSB repair occurred outside of the (CTG&#x2022;CAG)n sequence, both in E. coli (46) and in primate cells (43), frequent deletions of the triplet repeat along with flanking non-repeat sequence was noted. However, our data show that DSB repair outside of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence resulted in no additional instability of the repeat tract or the flanking sequence. These data indicate that the mechanism of DSB repair-mediated triplet-repeat instability is highly dependent on the sequence and/or physical properties of the repeat tract. Model of DSB repair within or outside of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence. (A, B) Single-strand annealing model of DSB repair is shown at the center (A) or off-center (B) within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence. If a DSB occurs within the repeat tract, a deletion could result if a single-strand exonuclease were to degrade DNA on either side of the break (only 3&#x2032; &#x2192; 5&#x2032; exonuclease is depicted here). The single-stranded (GAA)n and (TTC)n sequences (white and dark gray boxes) would anneal, followed by DNA polymerase re-synthesizing the gap, and sealing of the nick by DNA ligase. Note [as seen in (A)] that DSB repair at the center of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence would result in deletion of half of the repeat tract (if the entire repeat tract on each side were digested) or less than half (if less than the entire repeat tract on each were digested), consistent with our data. Furthermore, the DSB repair at the off-center location within the repeat tract [as seen in (B)] would preferentially delete the length of the shorter of the two flanking repeats (if the entire repeat tract on each side were digested), again consistent with our observations. (C) When DSB repair occurs outside of the repeat tract, and if the same process of single-strand exonuclease degradation were to occur, the only complementary sequence at which the resulting single-stranded DNA could anneal would be at the restriction enzyme sequence used to create the initial DSB. No loss of repeat sequence, and retention of the restriction site would be predicted, which is consistent with our data. (D) Alternatively, rather than the DNA being degraded by a single-strand exonuclease, DNA endonuclease processing of partially annealed strands on either side of the DSB could occur. The resulting single-stranded (GAA)n and (TTC)n sequences could anneal on opposite sides of the DSB, and an endonuclease could remove the flaps. DNA polymerase and DNA ligase would fill in and seal the nick, resulting in a shorter (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence. The same outcomes would be predicted with the endonuclease-mediated processing if the DSB were located at the center, or off-center, within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence.

DNA polymerase and DNA ligase would fill in and seal the nick, resulting in a shorter (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence. The same outcomes would be predicted with the endonuclease-mediated processing if the DSB were located at the center, or off-center, within the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence. It should be noted that both replication stalling and repeat instability are length- and orientation-dependent when plasmids containing the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence are propagated in E. coli. However, paradoxically our data show that DSB repair-mediated instability leads to the same frequency of deletions in both the GAA and TTC orientations, and this is independent of the length of the repeat tract. One way to reconcile these apparently conflicting observations is that, while a DSB in a repeat tract of any length and in any orientation is likely to result in a deletion, in nature DSBs may only be occurring in E. coli when the repeat length is in the GAA orientation and of sufficient length. It is plausible that the DSBs are a result of the replication stalling that preferentially occurs in the GAA orientation when plasmids containing repeat tracts of sufficient length are grown in E. coli, and this is why deletions are observed preferentially in the GAA orientation. It is also possible that some inherent property of the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence itself may make it more prone to breakage, whether it be a consequence of the repetitive nature of the DNA sequence per se, or due to a specific secondary structure adopted by the (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence (7&#x2013;10). It is also interesting to note that in tissues of FRDA patients there is a significant trend for large deletions of the expanded (GAA&#x2022;TTC)n sequence in the FXN gene (18,19,52). While all tissues show a significant frequency of contractions, peripheral blood cells are particularly prone to large deletions (18,19), which in some rare cases even results in complete reversion of the mutation to the non-pathogenic size. Indeed, the instability seen in blood is age dependent, with increasing mutation load as the patients get older (52). It is plausible that the proliferative nature of their precursor cells may afford multiple opportunities for DSB formation via replication fork stalling, thereby explaining the particularly large deletions in peripheral blood cells. The only other cells that show particularly large deletions, including occasional reversion to the normal size range are sperms from male FRDA patients (17). Again, human spermatozoa are generated following multiple pre-meiotic cellular divisions, thus allowing a similar opportunity to develop fork stalling, DSBs, and contractions. It is also likely, at least in FRDA patients, that the free radical-induced oxidative damage caused via mitochondrial frataxin deficiency (53) may further increase the possibility of DSBs. Both replication stalling in continuously proliferating cells and oxidative damage can potentially account for the age-dependent increase in contractions in vivo. Our data in E. coli therefore make a convincing case for the exploration of the potential role of DSB repair as a mechanism for somatic instability in mammalian cells.
