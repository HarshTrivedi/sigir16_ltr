  <title>Successful Multimodality Endoscopic Treatment of Gastric Outlet Obstruction Caused by an Impacted Gallstone (Bouveret's Syndrome)
</title>
  <abstract>
 Bouveret's syndrome is a rare condition of gastric outlet obstruction resulting from the migration of a gallstone through a choledochoduodenal fistula.  Due to the large size of these stones and the difficult location in which they become impacted, endoscopic treatment is unsuccessful and most patients require surgery. We report the case of an elderly male who presented with nausea and hematemesis, and was found on CT scan and endoscopy to have an obstructing gallstone in his duodenal bulb.  After several endoscopic sessions and the use of multiple instruments including a Holmium: YAG laser and electrohydraulic lithotripter, fragmentation and endoscopic removal of the stone were successful.  We believe this to be the first case of Bouveret's syndrome successfully treated by endoscopy alone in the United States. We describe the difficulties encountered which necessitated varied and innovative therapeutic techniques.

 Gastric  outlet obstruction by agallstone migrating through a cholecystoduodenalfistula (Bouveret's syndrome) is a very rare condition, accounting for fewerthan 5% of cases of gallstone ileus [1].Patients are often elderly with underlying comorbidities, which posessignificant challenges to both surgeons and endoscopists. Though there have been several cases ofBouveret's syndrome reported in the literature, there are only a few descriptionsof successful treatment with endoscopy alone.We report an unusual case of a large obstructing gallstone trapped inthe duodenal bulb and we discuss our successful endoscopic management using multipletherapeutic modalities. An 85-year-old male with advancedAlzheimer's dementia, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation presented withseveral days of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. There was no report ofabdominal pain, fever, or chills. Hisvital signs were stable and his abdominal exam benign. Nasogastric lavage was significant for one literof coffee-ground material. His laboratoryexamination demonstrated a white blood cellcount of 25&#x2009;000/cm2, Hematocrit of 33%, creatinine of 1.5&#x2009;mg/dL, and normal liver enzymes. A CT scan (seeFigure 1) showed a markedly distended stomach, air in the biliary tree, and a thickenedgallbladder containing one or  two  large gallstones,  the largest 3&#xD7;2.5&#x2009;cm insize, which appeared to be abutting the duodenal wall in an area of significantinflammation. Endoscopy demonstrated old blood ina distended stomach, and a large gallstone in the duodenal bulb obstructing thepylorus (see Figure 2(a)). Due to thepatient's advanced age and significant comorbidities, the patient's surgeonadvocated endoscopic treatment. Theposition of the gallstone, the surrounding ulcerated mucosa, and the size ofthe fistula's orifice made attempts to extractiondifficult despite the use of grasping forceps, jumbo biopsy forceps, different-sized and shaped snares, retrieval baskets and nets, as well as biliaryballoons and controlled radial expansion (CRE) balloons (see Figure 2(b)). There was no room to maneuver a mechanicallithotripter around the stone, so a Holmium: YAG laser lithotripter was used (BostonScientific Microvasive, Natick, Mass, USA).A 365-micron laser fiber was passed down one channel of adouble-therapeutic gastroscope (GIF 2T160, Olympus America, Inc., Pa, USA), and constant sterile water irrigation was infusedthrough the second channel. Using atotal of 3840 joules, 3917 pulses per second for a total time of 7 minutes and27 seconds, the laser successfully producedsmall cracks in the stone and ultimately fragmented the proximal portion (see Figure 3(a)); however, the procedure was terminated due to rapid atrial fibrillationand long procedure time. Three days later endoscopy wasrepeated, and an intracorporeal electrohydraulic lithotripter (IEHL; NorthgateTechnologies, Ill, USA), which was previously unavailable, was employed, asworking with the Holmium: YAG laser had been only partially successful. Using a 1.9F fiber (power of 1, increased to40; frequency of 10, increased to 30) under constant saline irrigation, IEHLwas successful at shattering the outer &#x201C;shell&#x201D; of the stone and breaking itinto two large pieces, leaving behind an extremely hard, smaller core (see Figure 3(b)). Ultimately, the majority of thestone was fragmented (Figure 3(c)) though the largerpiece still could not be removed easily from the duodenal bulb. Using a&#x201C;double-snare&#x201D; technique, two jumbo polypectomy snares (3&#xD7;6&#x2009;cm, Cook Endoscopy,Ind, USA) were used to grasp the still-impacted large stone fragment atdifferent angles and pull it into the stomach (see Figure 4). Examination of the remainder of the duodenumshowed no other stones. The largecholecystoduodenal fistula was visualized, and the gastroscope easily passedinto the lumen of the gallbladder (see Figure 5). Due to the length of the procedure, we choseto complete the endoscopy another  day. On repeat endoscopy, the largeststone fragment had again become impacted in the duodenal bulb, but wasextracted by placing a biliary balloon behind it and a polypectomy snare aroundits center. In the stomach, the largeststones could not be crushed despite use of a mechanical lithotripter. Tofurther break up the stones, we used the Holmium: YAG laser (1000-micron fiber for 128 joules for 427 pulsesper second for a total delivery time of 2 minutes and 49 seconds) to bore multipleholes into the center of each fragment, which was then crushed with a biliary stonebasket. The larger fragments wereremoved perorally (see Figure 6) with a Roth net (US Endoscopy, Ohio, USA), whilethe very small pieces were left behind to pass spontaneously. Two weeks later, a fourth endoscopy wasperformed to place a gastrostomy feeding tube, and no residual stones were seenin the stomach or duodenum. Additionally,the orifice of the cholecystoduodenal fistula was significantly smaller. Two months later, the patient remained asymptomatic. Bouveret's syndrome was firstdescribed in 1896 by Leon Bouveret, a French internist and masterfuldiagnostician, who reported two patients with large gallstones causing gastricoutlet obstruction, both of whom died [2].This is a very rare condition, representing fewer than 5% of cases ofgallstone ileus, which itself complicates cholelithiasis in only 0.3&#x2013;4% ofcases [1]. The condition has beenassociated with significant mortality despite modern surgical techniques, andis estimated to be 12&#x2013;30% [3]. The firstcase of successful endoscopic management of Bouveret's was in 1985 [4]. Sincethen there have been only a few other reports of endoscopic successes, somerequiring up to eight sessions [5&#x2013;9] despite the use of multiple devices including mechanical lithotriptors, electrohydraulic lithotripsy, and a varietyof laser lithotripters (e.g., Holmium: YAG, Rhoadmine 6G, FREDDY). Even extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL),another option for nonsurgical treatment, is rarely successful [10] and notalways readily available. In a recentreview of the literature, Lowe et al. demonstrated that more than 90%ofpatients ultimately require surgical management [1]. Our case is representative of thetypical patient with Bouveret's, as well as the difficult challenges involvedin approaching the endoscopic management.Due to multiple comorbidities and a severely ulcerated duodenum, thesurgeons were hesitant to operate. Thelarge size of the stone (more than 3&#x2009;cm in diameter), its location, and thepropensity for instruments to follow the fistulous tract rather than theduodenal lumen made maneuvering extremely difficult, and precluded the use of amechanical lithotripter. We chose the Holmium: YAG laser and IEHLbecause of their prior successes in treating difficult common bile duct stones,as well as their availability at our institution. We found the Holmium: YAG laser to be usefulin producing initial cracks in the stone's surface; IEHL, however, seemed to bemore effective in uniformly shattering the outer surface though not veryeffective at attacking its harder, inner core.Using both lithotripters required a significant amount of time, in partbecause of the minimal working space as well as the extreme care involved inavoiding further damage to the already ulcerated bulbar mucosa. Using laser or IEHL fibers of larger diametermay have improved the efficiency of lithotripsy, but these were not availableto us. When approaching the large stone fragmentsin the stomach, we found &#x201C;drilling&#x201D; multiple holes with the Holmium: YAG laserto weaken the internal structure of the stone's core to be a very usefultechnique which then allowed us to easily crush these large fragments with abasket. We also found that to successfully extractthe stone from the bulb after lithotripsy, a single instrument did not provideenough leverage or balance. Using twoinstruments with a double-channel gastroscope, however, was proved to be successful twice (onceusing two snares, once using a snare and a biliary balloon). Another important observation inour case was that between the second and third endoscopies, one of the stone fragmentsleft in the stomach again became impacted in the duodenal bulb. Fortunately, this happened to be quite alarge fragment, for a smaller piece might have traversed the duodenum andlodged in the ileum causing a distal gallstone ileus requiring surgery. This complication has indeed been reported severaltimes in the literature [11, 12]. Wetherefore recommend that caution be used when leaving stones in the stomachbetween treatment sessions. Anasogastric tube was used to decrease the risk of vomiting and aspirating stonefragments. Finally, two weeks afterstone extraction, the size of the fistula was seen to be much smaller. Surgical closure of the fistula is notcurrently recommended; in fact in patients with Bouveret's undergoingenterolithotomy, the fistulas are left undisturbed and usually do not causecomplications [1]. We believe our case to be the firstfull-length report of the successful treatment in the United States ofBouveret's syndrome with endoscopy alone, as well as a unique description ofthe complementary use of different lithotriptors and instruments. Our experience suggests that endoscopistsfaced with this clinical problem should use a double channel gastroscope,initiate stone fragmentation with IEHL as first line management, crush stonefragments that are left in the stomach to prevent ileal obstruction, and expectmultiple endoscopic sessions. We anticipate that due to the aging population inthe US  and the epidemic of obesity, Bouveret's will likely become more common thanpreviously reported. It is, therefore,important for endoscopists to be familiar with the multiple options availableto effectively treat these difficult cases without surgery.
